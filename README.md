# French Phone Numbers And Email Extractor

Automate The Boring Stuff Chapter 7 Project

This is my take on the Phone and Email Extractor project. I adapted the regular expressions to search for French phone numbers and for email adresses.
I tested this program using [this list of contact details](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/Liste-et-coordonnees-des-associations-nationales). 

## Getting Started

For this project, you will need Python3 installed and the pyperclip module.

## Installing
